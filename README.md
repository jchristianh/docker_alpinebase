Zen Alpine Base (Docker)
====================

This image will build a base Alpine Linux image for use with my Chef CI container for Gitlab CI + Chef Cookbook testing.

Requirements

As this is based on the Docker.io CentOS image, you will need that image in order to build this one:

- Docker.io CentOS 7 Base:
  CentOS 7.2.1511 / docker pull docker.io/centos:7.2.1511
